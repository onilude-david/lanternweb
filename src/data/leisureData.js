                text: `Once upon a time, in the animal kingdom, there was a great famine. All the animals were thin and hungry, except for the birds. The birds had been invited to a great feast in the sky by the people of the heavens.

The Tortoise, who was very cunning and also very hungry, saw the birds preparing for their journey. He went to them and asked, "My friends, where are you going looking so happy and full of anticipation?"

"We have been invited to a feast in the sky!" chirped the birds. "There will be yam, and soup, and fruits of all kinds!"

The Tortoise's mouth watered. "Oh, please, take me with you!" he begged. "I am starving, and I have not eaten a good meal in weeks."

The birds looked at him and laughed. "You have no wings, Tortoise! How will you fly to the sky?"

"You can each give me one feather," suggested the Tortoise. "If you all contribute, I will have enough feathers to make a pair of wings."

The birds thought about this. They were kind-hearted, and they felt sorry for the Tortoise. So, each bird plucked a feather and gave it to him. The Tortoise glued the feathers to his shell and, to everyone's surprise, he could fly!`

                text: `As they flew towards the sky, the Tortoise said, "My friends, it is a custom that when we go to a great feast, we must take new names. It shows respect to our hosts."

The birds agreed that this sounded like a wise custom. They all chose new names for themselves. "I shall be called Swift," said the Eagle. "I shall be called Bright," said the Parrot.

"And what shall you be called, Tortoise?" they asked.

The Tortoise smiled a wicked smile. "I shall be called 'All of You'."

The birds thought this was a strange name, but they accepted it. When they arrived in the sky, the hosts were happy to see them. They brought out huge platters of steaming food.

"Who is this food for?" asked the Tortoise.

"It is for all of you," replied the hosts, gesturing to the group.

The Tortoise stepped forward. "You hear that?" he said to the birds. "The food is for 'All of You'. That is my name! You must wait until I have finished eating."`

                text: `The birds were furious, but they could do nothing. They watched as the Tortoise ate the best parts of the food and drank the sweetest wine. By the time he was full, only scraps remained.

Angry and hungry, the birds decided to teach the Tortoise a lesson. One by one, they took back the feathers they had given him.

"Give me back my feather!" squawked the Eagle.
"And mine!" screeched the Hawk.

Soon, the Tortoise was left with no wings. He looked down at the earth far below. He was stranded in the sky.

"Please," he begged the birds, "tell my wife to bring out all the soft things in the house—mattresses, pillows, blankets—and pile them in the compound so I can jump down safely."

The birds agreed to deliver the message, but they decided to play a trick of their own. When they got to the Tortoise's house, they told his wife, "Your husband says you should bring out all the hard things—stones, rocks, and iron pots—and pile them in the compound."

The Tortoise's wife, being an obedient woman, did as she was told. The Tortoise, seeing the pile from far above, thought it was the soft landing he had requested. He took a deep breath and jumped.

CRASH! He landed on the hard stones and his smooth shell shattered into many pieces. The ants and the local healer had to glue his shell back together. That is why, to this day, the Tortoise has a cracked and bumpy shell.`

The bus ride was long and noisy. Everyone was singing songs and pointing out things through the window. "Look! A cow!" shouted Tunde. "Look! A big bridge!" shouted Mary.

Sade sat quietly, clutching her bag. She had seen pictures of the ocean in books, but she had never seen it with her own eyes. She wondered if it was really as blue as the pictures showed.`

"Wow!" gasped the children.

The ocean stretched out as far as the eye could see. It was huge, blue, and sparkling in the sun. Waves crashed against the shore with a rhythmic roar.

Sade took off her sandals and felt the warm sand between her toes. It tickled! She ran towards the water but stopped just before the waves could touch her feet. She giggled as the water rushed up and then pulled back.`
